        value type stores the actual value in stack. Reference type stores the address in the stack, and the address points to heap. The actual value of refernce type is in heap.
        boxing: value type -> reference type
        unboxing: reference type -> value type

        managed resource: the object will be managed by  CLR and clean by garbage collector automatically.
        unmanaged resource: the object will be cleaned manually by calling the dispose method from IDisposable interface

        prevent memory leak, reduce heap usage,manage the heap usage, and optimise performance.


        Test your knowledge:
        1.What happens when you divide an int variable by 0?
        It will not compile and ide gives DivideByZeroException
        
        2.What happens when you divide a double variable by 0?
        (positive double)/0=(positive infinity), (negative double)/0=(negative infinity)
        
        3.
        it will go to the other end.e.x. If it exceed max number, it will start from min number.

        x=y++ => x=y, then y+=1
        x=++y => y+=1, then x=y

        break will jump out of the loop
        continue will ignore the rest code inside the loop and start the next turn
        return will exit the function. It will also break the loop

        condition: i<10;
        iteration: i++;

        byte's max value is 255. It will loop forever.


        add folowing before the code
        if (max > byte.MaxValue){
         Debug.Log("infinite loop!!");
        }

        1. Use string when we do not need to modify the string. Use stringbuilder when we need to modify the string.
        2.System.Array
        3.Array.Sort(list); Array.Sort(list,ComparingFunction);
        4 list.Length
        5. by default no. But if you declare Object[], which is not recommanded, you could store multiple types.
        6. CopyTo() need to take an array and a start index as arguments. It will copy the element to an existing array.
          Clone() return an new array.
          Both perform shallow copy, which only copy refernce other than creating new object.
